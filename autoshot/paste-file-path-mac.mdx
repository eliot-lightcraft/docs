title: 'Pasting File Paths on the Mac'

After running Autoshot to generate a SynthEyes (or other) script, you’ll need to point SynthEyes to the correct directory to run that script. You can click the highlighted file line in Autoshot to open up a Finder window that is set to the correct directory, and then select and copy the file path that is at the bottom of the Finder window.

So — how do you then paste a file path on the Mac?

The answer (from user JPTX1292!) is to use Command+Shift+G anywhere inside the Finder file browser, or whenever a 3rd party software uses the Finder window to retrieve a file!

Here’s the sequence in SynthEyes:
