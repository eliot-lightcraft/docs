## Export Take Zip

File -> Export Take Zip will write out the complete dataset of the selected take, including the captured Jetset camera original, live composite, depth video, and tracking metadata original files into a ZIP file archive that can easily be loaded into Autoshot.

We’ll use the same tool to debug the take that you’re using to work with it.

If the selected take is a Cine take, it will also write out the cine camera original file into the archive. This can become large, so write the zip file into a drive with sufficient space.

## Export Take Zip with Source Blend

Use this option if you’re working with a Blender scene file that you want to include in the zip archive. This is useful when debugging how a specific take aligns into the target blend file.

Autoshot will add whatever Blender file is currently pointed to by the ‘Scene Blend File’ line in the Run Values section.

## Send Take Via Email Link

Once you’ve zipped up the take, send the resulting (large) zip file to support@lightcraft.pro as a link to a file download service like Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.

A take zip file can easily exceed a gigabyte in size, so they can’t be emailed directly.

## Opening Take Zip Files

You can use this to send take zips back and forth to your colleagues, as well. After you download a take zip file, unzip it to a hard drive (with enough space), then point the Autoshot Project Folder line to the Project folder inside the unzipped folder tree.

Autoshot will automatically recognize the take day and selected take (as there is only one take day and take in a take zip file!) and select them in the Take Selection section. You can then process the take normally.
