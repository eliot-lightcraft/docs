## Share with App Developers

Inside your iPhone/iPad’s Settings menu, browse to Privacy & Security -> Analytics & Improvements -> Share With App Developers, and enable the switch:

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/debugging/AppAnalytics-277x600.jpg"
/>

You’ll need to enable this, and then restart the app before the log will start to be saved.

## Saving Log Files

Inside the Jetset app, go to Main Menu -> Settings & Support -> Settings, enable ‘Save log file in SPOOL folder’, and click Done.

<img
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
  src="/images/debugging/JetsetEnableLog-600x277.jpg"
/>

Then, Jetset will start saving to (in the Files app) On My iPhone/Jetset/INTERNAL/SPOOL/jetset.log.

Note — don’t enable saving the log file in production; this is for debugging purposes only.

## Sending the Log Files

After you’ve enabled the above, and Jetset crashes, we still need to receive it!

To send it, navigate to the jetset.log file in the Files app (On My iPhone/Jetset/INTERNAL/SPOOL/jetset.log), and send it to support@lightcraft.pro with a quick note on what was happening when Jetset crashed.
