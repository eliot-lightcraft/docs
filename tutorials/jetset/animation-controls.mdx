# Transcription

Jetset now has an integrated animation timeline interface with controls both on the app side and in the remote control browser page. And these controls let you easily scrub through an imported animation, find a good starting point, and then trigger the animation on command with the timing decisions automatically recorded and rippled back through Autoshot.


## Jetset Timeline UI 

We'll start by loading in an animated USDZ model, and the updated Jetset UI now has a single control screen with a ghost slider that lets you slide between the camera original view and, and the composite view.

And on top there's now an animation timeline slider and a play pause button. So we hit play. Then we can see the animation starting to work. And it'll, it'll go through and naturally cycle around. So then we can scrub through the animation to find a good starting point. So we'll hit pause. And now we can roll a take. 

And hit play to start the playback of the animation at that point. 

And when we cut, the animation pauses. 


## Remote UI

This is fine for simple things, but in many cases we want to have a remote operator control or trigger the animation on command. For these cases, we'll open up our remote control web browser. The easiest way to do this is to run Autoshot, go to our takes panel see the automatically detected Jetset model and click open web page. This will bring up our browser remote control interface. 


## Timeline Settings

And by default, it'll go to the slate interface, as usual, but we can also go to the settings interface.

And we can see here we have a couple of different controls for the animation. We can tell it to restart animation when we hit record. And we can tell it to stop animation when we stop recording. That's how we currently have it set. 


## Timeline UI

Well, now let's switch to the video panel. As before, we have our video controls, and we have a timeline control down here with animations for play and pause, as well as a slider. We can take our slider and scroll through the animation. 


## Reset Point

And what this does is we've set our reset point at a point that's about six tenths of the way through the entire timeline. 

This is the point that the animation will jump to when reset. And next to here we have the animation reset button. So a reset occurs when the reset animation is pressed. We can click it here and it's not going to do anything because it was already at the reset point.

Or if the restart animation on record checkbox is enabled, then the user rolls a Jetset take. 


## Example Take

So let's work through this. So we've set the animation to a point just before where the robot gets up. It's going to get up here, so we're going to set the animation here.

And now we're going to roll the Jetset take. 

Note that the animation is still paused, and at a cue on the director, we can hit play, and the robot will get up. Alright, and then we can hit cut. Now the animation is paused, we can click animation reset, and it'll move back to the reset point. And again, all of the animation timing decisions that we make here are saved in the take metadata, and we can automatically reconstruct them in the Autoshot post production files. So that covers it for animation remote control.
