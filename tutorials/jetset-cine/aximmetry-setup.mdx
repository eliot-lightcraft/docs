## Updated C-Tracking name

Aximmetry just renamed AGTP to 'C-Tracking', or a 'Comprehensive Tracking Protocol,' so in newer versions of Aximmetry (version 5.5+) please select C-Tracking instead of AGTP!

# Transcription

All right, I'm going to start from scratch using for the Aximmetry setup the easiest way I can, I'm going to use the Decklink since anyone can use it. This is the installed one and its own little box with the USB plugged into the computer or into the laptop. And let's begin.


## Opening Unreal Editor for Aximmetry

All right, so I made a, I used a Courtyard modular courtyard free map, and I'm going to now open up the special Unreal from Aximmetry . Now I'm going to open up the modular Courtyard. And I'm going to hit Open and it's going to create a copy there. It is Modular Courtyard, and it's copying everything over, including the USD Zs and the Blend files that I made.

Notice that it added the 5.4 on there.


## Adding Camera

All right, here's our new model, and all I'm going to do is add camera, the second one, the second selection,

and there it goes. And this is the X axis that it landed on, which is very far away from the actual place. So that's why we need the.

The scene lock. Alright, so that's what I'm going to do there. I'm going to save this.


## Opening Aximmetry Composer

Now let's open up Aximmetry. So I'm going to open up Composer.

I already have the USDZ loaded in the phone.

All right, so I have the Decklink there with the camera feed. All right. And then here's the A GTP set up. Let me show you how that was done. So here we go.

So I got the 1 5 4, which is my computer, and that's how I have it set.

Here.

Right there. So saved to the computer. Now let's go back and let's, so let's drag these in from scratch. So the video, the Decklink is a feed. We're going to take the camera tracking and then drag that in there. And this is our output. Which is the monitor. Go to create a new blank document. All right, so there's nothing here.

We're going to drag the Unreal camera link right there,

step one.

And the next step is we're going to go find our folder. With the Aximmetry one, the new one created. So it's 5.4 and we're going to drag this in here.

And then since I didn't cook it, we're going to go live sync. And now I have to, now it's asking me to hit plain Unreal so I could connect it. So there we go. Let's do that. Boom. Nothing's, it doesn't look right. That's okay. Now we hit link. There we go. I like to sometimes turn on the low latency, which should work.

So that's only happened, shows up when I select it here. Alright, so we're going to go the two outputs so we can see what they're doing. Preview, and then out. Now you see that right here, we're going to get our feed. So there we go.

I hope that you can see my mouse in the recording. Yep. There it is. Okay.

All right. Now here's the steps. So let's go. This one's A. This one messed me up while so out has to go to rendered B, mask to B mask. Then we go. Match these up by name.

We're starting to see some progress b texture.

Okay. So we should have connection. There we go. Panning the camera back and forth. Looks good. All right. Next steps. Cameras. We can, I think we can ignore that one for now. Alright. Studio mass mode. Very important. Turn that off. There we go. Now we have the camera feed, so we got latency off. So let's start from studio and move on to input.

So this has our mapped inputs, Decklink one, and then right there, whatever the edit the tracking. So camera delay, we're going to set that to two. And for this one, the,

the AJA was negative two.

So this one seems to be the same. Alright, so tracking, delay negative two, camera delay two. That seemed to work great and it looks looking great here. Everything matches fantastic.


## Setting the Keyer

Okay, now we're going to go to Keyer. And this is the easiest way I found out how to key go over to color picker and let's make that a little bigger trigger.

Lemme go back to advanced P now. It should look great.

So I think there's a little delay. So let's go back to input tracking delays one. I think the Decklink is much quicker.

All right, let's go back to two.

All right let's key clean up our green screen a little bit.

There we go. Nice and clean. And

that pretty much concludes. How to do this. Make sure save it. I like to save it in the same folder real projects, modular courtyard, and I'll just call this modular courtyard as well.

Save. There you go. Modular courtyard.

Got my GPU running pretty good.

All right.
