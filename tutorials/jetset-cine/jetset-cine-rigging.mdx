Okay, we are going to go through assembling and rigging all the pieces for uh, to connect to Jetset Cine uh, and an iPhone onto an actual Cine camera. And so we'll go through the different rigging pieces in this case for a Blackmagic, a pocket Cinema camera. And we'll start up.


## Cine Camera Cage

Okay, so let's start off with assembling the small rig cage onto the, onto the Blackmagic device. So we can just point our camera straight up, there 

and it's a bit of a tight fit, okay. So then, once the cage is, is on, we have three screw, three screw points that we can Uh, to connect it with. There are two screw points at the bottom, at the base. Screw

those tight. And I'll get them mostly tight, but not completely tight. And we're going to flip it over. And there's a third screw mount on the top.

Okay. Once all three of those are reasonably tight, we can go ahead and tighten them completely. Oop. Don't go too hard, bebecause it's aluminum.

Okay. So our, our cage is on I'm gonna put this over to the side.


## iPhone Cage

Next we're going to assemble the phone cage to the rail blocks and the phone cage is set up so that has, has a direction so that the phone can fit into it correctly. So we'll mount the phone into this. It only has really one direction it's supposed to go into.

Then we can close it. And then, since We want the phone to be mounted, so that the lens side is down is down low close to the close to the Cine lens, that means we're going to put the rail blocks on the bottom of this and here's a set of our of the rail blocks This is a 15 millimeter rail block. All right, and uh, so then 

There's a set of quarter 20 holes on the top or on the bottom of this that we're going to be mounting that to and if we just directly place these the holes will line up. Now the problem is if we screw them on in all the way the screws are just slightly too long for the depth of the the threaded holes that they're going into and so this will wiggle. So in order to remove the wiggle, we're going to add in two quarter 20 washers Just generic quarter inch washers between the threaded hole and the rail mount.

So now we can tighten those.

Go ahead and tighten it correctly. With all of these, we want to keep the connections fairly tight so that it won't wiggle. Okay. So there we have a phone. And so we have the mounting point of the phone low and close to the rail block, as close to the rail block mounts as we can get. Okay, great. So I'm gonna put that aside.


## Rails on Camera Cage

Next we're going to bring the camera back, we can put the rail block directly on top of the camera. As you can see, the two screws will line up correctly with two mounts on the top of the camera. So we can move that there and directly tighten those

and tighten it correctly.

And this one, we don't need the washers because it's mounting rigidly. Okay. Next step, we're going to attach the two rails. One here, one here, and these are carbon rails, so they're very lightweight. And then once they're in place, we can tension, we can tighten the knob, this knob.

And these are spring loaded ratchets, so these can be adjusted later on, you can pull them out and adjust the, adjust the tension on it so we can, we can move those where they need to be. Okay, so now we've got our rail block mounts, and now we can actually, come back out a little bit.


## Mounting iPhone to Rails

Now we can actually go ahead and mount our Cine, our iPhone directly onto the rails.

We can adjust our spring tension clamp, slide them on, and we're usually going to have this located as close as we can to the front element of the lens. Typically the entry pupil of a lens is somewhere very, very close to the, to the front front element on a wide end, wide angle lens.

And so our lens calibration system can account for misalignments, but in order to keep the preview through the aiming reticule on the Jetset Cine display as close as possible to the camera then we want to keep these, keep these fairly close. So once that's in place, we can, we can tighten the clamps.

Now we have the phone mounted on the camera. 


## Accsoon SeeMo

And the next thing we're going to want to mount on is an Accsoon SeeMo. In this case we we have the, the SeeMo 4k. This is an HDMI camera. And so the SeeMo 4k can take an HDMI input. And so there's a couple of very useful things. One is the SeeMo comes with a cold shoe mount. So we're just going to mount that right into a cold shoe mount on On the camera.


## MagSafe Cooler

Okay. So now we have our CMO rigged onto the camera. The next thing we're going to want to do is a very important thing, which is a cooler. So the cooler is key to all of this. So this is a Razer cooler, we also have the Black Shark cooler on the website, and the cooler is what keeps the phone cool.

The iPhone can work very, very well in production for many hours at a time, but you have to keep it cool, and the cooler is the way to do that. And the cooler has an integrated uSB C 5V connector on it. So we're just going to MagSafe it. So the cooler just connects onto the the back of the iPhone via the MagSafe connectors. 

Once that's connected, we can connect a power connector from the USB C port on the on the phone or on the mag, on the cooler back to a 5 volt output port on the Accsoon. And now we have, now we have cooling. Actually, we can flip it this way. Clean up the cables a little bit. 


## Video Cable to iPhone

Alright next we're going to need to connect the actual video output from the Accsoon to the iPhone.

And this is done with a special, a special connector cable. Connects from video out over to the iPhone. And we'll flip that around a little bit to clear the battery slot. 


## NP-F Battery

We're going to mount a battery. This is a standard NPF battery to the Accsoon.


## HDMI to SeeMo

And finally, we're going to connect an HDMI cable from the Axon, from the SeeMo.

To the input of the Blackmagic. So the Blackmagic camera has an HT MI port cover here. Now actually we will open up a couple of the different ports 'because we're going to use them. We'll open up the HDMI, we're gonna open up the microphone an audio port jack 'because we're going to use that for time code.

And we're going to open up the USB cable. So we're gonna, we're going to open up all three of those. 

Okay, and so we're going to connect the, an HDMI cable, a short HDMI cable from, from the Axiom to the HDMI port of the Blackmagic. Okay, so, that is, that handles the connections for the CMO. 


## Tentacle Sync 

But there's an, an additional piece we're going to need to do, that's very important, and that is the Tentacle Sync.

The Tentacle Sync is a nifty device that we can both transmit time code into the Blackmagic so that we can synchronize all of our time code together, and it can connect to, to Jetset so that our tracking data will have the same embedded time code or almost the same embedded time code as the Cine camera.

Jetset records internally at 30 frames per second. And the Cine camera is usually set to 24 or 25. But other than that, it's actually a quite close match. And this will help us enormously for both the live render preview and for automatic take matching and post production. So this is a highly recommended little device.

So we'll connect the mounting point here.

We'll clamp,

make sure we clear the on off switch.

Okay. And then finally

we can connect our, the. timecode connector from here down into our timecode port on the Blackmagic device. There's a little microphone jack that goes in there. Okay. And that sets up our timecode. 


## External Hard Drive

Lastly, we can, we're going to use an external hard drive to store our B RAW takes and connect USB C

over to our USB C port Internally.


## Set Up Timecode

Okay. So there we have a rigged camera. So let's go and do some setup to make sure things are working correctly. I'm going to turn on the Blackmagic camera.

Okay. I'm going to turn on the SEMO

and I'm going to turn on the Tentacle.

The Tentacle will start out blinking red which means that it is acquiring time code. We actually want it to send its own time code. 

And we'll go into this in more detail, but I'm going to use the Tentacle app And we can see the current time code. We're gonna double, we're gonna tap on the time code that lets us either set it to a specific time, 10 o'clock, for example. We can see the Cine camera reflect the time code coming in. We're actually gonna change that back to time of date.

Phone time. All right. So now we can see that it's 1353 here and 1353 on the camera. 

So, great. So now we know that our, our Cine camera is receiving the time code from the Tentacle correctly and then we can move on.
