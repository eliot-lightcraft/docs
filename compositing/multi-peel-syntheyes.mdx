## Synthia Natural Language

Synthia is a natural language interface; it provides a great way to automate SynthEyes tasks for tracking artists that don’t want to deal with the technical details of Sizzle or Python, the other scripting languages that SynthEyes supports.

To get an idea of how easy it is to automate tasks, here’s the script:

***

  //Multi-Peel MATTMERK Style

  say ““.
  say “Don't multitask while running: check email, twitter, etc. 😉“.
  say “It will grab window focus and crash the script“.
  say ““.

  features room.

  make current camera’s small blip density 0.008.
  make current camera’s big blip density 0.004.
  make current camera’s small blip size 8.
  make current camera’s big blip size 16.
  make current camera’s maximum tracker count number of frames*2.2.

  click and wait for “blips all frames” button.
  //wait 2 seconds.
  click and wait for “peel All” button.
  //wait 2 seconds.
  clear all blips.
