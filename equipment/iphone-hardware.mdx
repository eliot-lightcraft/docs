## iOS Hardware Families

ARKit, the underlying real time tracking technology that Jetset uses to measure camera motion, has been in iOS devices since 2017, but the capabilities of iOS devices have changed enormously during the development of Jetset.

The hardware capabilities largely break down into 3 ‘families’ of devices that can run Jetset:

- iPhone XR/XS, iPhone 11 Pro — these phones work, but their lack of LiDAR sensor and low GPU memory means they have model limit sizes and can’t do the 3D scanning that is really critical for Jetset Cine.
- iPhone 12/13/14 Pro — these phones have LiDAR which makes them a good fit for Cine. They can load mid sized models (150MB-250MB)
- iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad Pro — these devices have powerful GPUs and good cooling. They also mark the introduction of the USB-C port for power and data. This enables the use of a USB-C to Ethernet cable for data offtake, which is 10x faster than the previous Lightning to Ethernet adapter, and is 20x faster than wifi.
- iPhone 16 Pro Max - the best device yet. Improved power, cooling, and tracking over the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

The differences come down to heat, LiDAR sensor presence/absence, and the size of 3D model that the GPU can render.

### Heat 

Using Jetset for longer periods of time will heat up the device. The iPhone XR/XS, 11, 12, 13, and 14 all handle heat incrementally better, but an external cooler is still needed to use the phone in any sort of production scenario.

We recommend the [BlackShark](/equipment/camera-checklist#cooling) coolers, which can be powered by a USB-C connector.

Even when operating the iPhone without a Cine rig, you can use a [cage with a battery plate](/equipment/camera-checklist#battery-plate) to hold a NP-F battery. This enables power and cooling for the iPhone.
