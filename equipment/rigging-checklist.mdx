## Overview

Jetset Cine uses an iPhone connected to a cine camera to accurately calibrate the cine lens optics and 3D offset from the iPhone.

For this to be accurate, a few goals are critical:

- Rigidity: once the phone and lens are calibrated to each other, moving the iPhone accidentally will disrupt the calibration. You want this to stay locked.
- Light weight: to balance the rig on a lightweight gimbal like a RS2 or RS3, the weight needs to be kept to a minimum.
- Cooler clearance: when running an iPhone Magsafe cooler (recommended), the iPhone cage can’t get in the way of the cooler mount.
- We’ll list some of the rigging setups we use from different manufacturers below.

### Camera Cage

### Magic Arm With Arri 3/8-16 mount

[Rosette Magic Arm (11") with 3/8”-16 ARRI Locating Screw](https://www.smallrig.com/Rosette-Magic-Arm-11-inch-with-ARRI-Locating-Screw-4900.html)

This magic arm has an Arri 3/8-16 thumbscrew on one side, and a standard 1/4-20 thumbscrew on the other end. The Arri side connects to one of the 3/8-16 mounts on the Smallrig cages, and provides much more gripping power. The 1/4-20 side screws into the threaded holes on the iPhone cage.

An example of the mounted setup can be seen here:

### 15mm Rail Block

[Super Lightweight 15mm-Railblock](https://www.smallrig.com/smallrig-super-lightweight-15mm-railblock-2pcs-pack-2061.html)

An alternative and more rigid way to mount the iPhone to the cage is with rail blocks mounted to both the iPhone cage and camera cage, and then connected with 15mm carbon fiber matte box rails.

This can take a bit more work to set up but is pretty bulletproof once rigged. The stock screw length is just a little long, so use a 1/4″ washer between the cage and the rails on either end to space them out and secure a tight fit.

### 1/4" Washers

[100PCS 1/4" Black Stainless Steel Flat Washers](https://a.co/d/5etoMr7)

Use these washers to take up the small amount of slack left when assembling the Smallrig cages to the rail block mounts.

### Carbon Fiber Rods

[Carbon Fiber Rod (15mm)](https://www.smallrig.com/15mm-carbon-fiber-rod-30cm-12inch-2pcs-851.html)

These 15mm carbon fiber rails fit the rail blocks shown above and are lightweight and rigid.
