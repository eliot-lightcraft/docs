## Scene Locators

Scene locators are empty 3D nulls that Jetset uses to navigate through larger scenes, and to rapidly link a live action location to matching virtual location.

Scene locators use the prefix 'sceneloc_' followed by a user-specified name, for example **sceneloc_Front_Door**. 

No spaces are allowed in scene locator names.

## Adding Scene Locators
 
In Blender, set the 3D cursor with Shift-RMB. 

Then hit Shift-A to Add, and select Empty and Arrows. 

F2 to rename the empty, and type 'sceneloc_My_Custom_Name.'

## Scene Locator Scale 

Scene locator scales should usually be 1.0. This way, 1 meter of motion by the user will translate to 1 meter of motion in the virtual scene.

If a scene locator has a non-zero scale, the Jetset motion will be amplified by the scale amount. 

For example, a scene locator with an XYZ scale of 25 would result in one meter of motion by the operator translating to 25 meters of motion in the virtual scene.

This will break live action tracking, but can be useful for simulating cranes or drone camera moves in a pure CG environment. 

Scene locators with custom scales should be named appropriately with the specified scale, for example sceneloc_street_crane_25x.
