## Suggested Formats

1. H.264 (AVC)
- Container: MP4 or MOV
- Profiles/Levels:
  - High Profile at level 4.2 is most common for high‐quality streaming and video textures.
  - Other profiles: Baseline or Main profiles may be used if lower decoding complexity is desired, but High Profile is recommended for best quality on iPhone 12+.
2. HEVC (H.265)
- Container: MP4 or MOV
- Profiles/Levels:
  - Main 10 Profile is recommended for improved compression and 10‑bit color support (ideal for richer color and dynamic range).
  - Levels supported on iPhone 12 typically go up to around level 5.1.
