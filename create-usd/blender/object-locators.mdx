## Object Locators

Object locators are empty 3D nulls that Jetset uses to let users interactively move objects in the scene.

Object locators use the prefix 'objectloc_' followed by a user-specified name, for example **objectloc_Actor_Bob**. 

No spaces are allowed in object locator names.

## Adding Object Locators
 
In Blender, select the object you wish to add an object locator to.

Set Blender's 3D cursor to the object position with Shift-S, and then choose 'Cursor to Selected'.

Then hit Shift-A to Add, and select Empty and Arrows. 

F2 to rename the empty, and type 'objectloc_My_Custom_Name.'

Select the Blender object that you wish to move with the object locator, then Ctrl-LMB to select the object locator. Move your cursor into the main viewport area, then press Ctrl-P to Parent the object. Choose 'Keep Transform' to avoid moving the object or the object locator.

The result should look like this in the Outliner.

/>

Export to USDZ as per usual practice.

## Using Object Locators

In Jetset, after importing the USDZ file, navigate to the 'Object Move' tab. Jetset will parse the list of objectloc_* nulls in the current USDZ file, and provide a list.

/>

Highlight the object you wish to move, in this case 'cube'. 

You can then drag the cube around on the horizontal plane with your finger. 

Tap the visibility icon to show or hide the object.

Tap the rotation icon to interactively rotate the object.

Tap the Z icon to interactively move the object up or down.

Click OK when done moving the objects to return to the main screen.

Object locator positions are stored on a per-take basis in the take metadata, and can be viewed with the 'i' button in Autoshot next to the currently selected take.
