Fab.com includes the fantastic Quixel Megascans collection. These assets are available for free, and can be downloaded in either FBX or Unreal format.

The 'FBX' download has the materials and objects separated into individual folders with either a set of texture maps (for the materials) or a FBX file and a set of texture maps (for the 3D objects.)

## Lightcraft Batch Importer

Lightcraft's [Batch Importer](https://github.com/LightcraftTechnology/Batch-Import-BlenderAssets) can directly import all of the assets in the unzipped FBX download from Fab.com.
