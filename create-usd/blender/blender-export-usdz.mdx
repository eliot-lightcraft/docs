## Texture Compression

As seen in the [Autoshot Blender Round Trip](/tutorials/blender-workflows/autoshot-blender-round-trip) tutorial, Blender can export to a standard USD file directory with full resolution textures.

In the tutorial, we then used Autoshot to compress those 2K/4K original textures down to 512x512, and then wrapped the USD and texture files into a USDZ file ready to be pushed to Jetset.

However, Blender can also directly write to USDZ while compressing textures, which can save a step.

To do this, just use a .usdz file extension, and set the USDZ Texture Downsampling value to 512 or another small value.

Blender will compress the textures to that value and write a USDZ file with the compressed textures directly.
