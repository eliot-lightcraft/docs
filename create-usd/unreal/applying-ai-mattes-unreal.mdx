User CptGabok wrote this great update to using the AI generated rotomattes with the Unreal Material Keyer generated with the level sequences by Autoshot.

1. Change the material type for the CamMaterialTemplate to Masked
2. Use the AIMatteTexture Media Texture as the Opacity Mask within the CamMaterialTemplate
3. Add a Media Track to the Level Sequence
4. Select the AIMatteMediaSource as the Media Source for the new Media Track
5. Select the AIMatteTexture as the Media Texture for the AIMatteMediaSource

Then you should see the rotoscoped footage within Unreal Engine playing back as you scrub the timeline.
