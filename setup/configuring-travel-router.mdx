## Power 

The GLi Net routers use a standard 5V/3A USB-C power adapter.

## Connect

Connect your Mac/PC via Ethernet. The GLi Net router has a default IP address ofhttp://192.168.8.1.

Choose your language.

There is no default password for the Admin panel. You have to set your own. 

## Configure Internet

The most likely configuration methods you will use are as a Repeater or Tethering.

### Repeater

This method connects to an existing wireless network. Choose a SSID from the drop-down list and enter its password. Toggle *Remember* on and then *Join*.

### Tethered

This method uses another iPhone connected to the outside internet over cellular over a USB cable.

Connect the iPhone to the USB port of the router. Click 'Trust' to continue.

Go to iPhone->Settings->Personal Hotspot and enable 'Allow Others to Join'.

On another computer or iPhone, connect to the router, go to the web Admin panel, choose 'Internet' and click 'Connect'.

It will show connected information at the top of your phone screen.
