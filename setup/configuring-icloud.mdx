title: 'Configuring iCloud (Optional)'
description: 'If you plan to use iCloud to store your takes, follow this configuration guide. Note that most production groups will not use iCloud, and will instead use the App Storage or User-Defined storage choices described in [Creating Jetset Projects](/setup/create-project).'

## Enable iCloud

If this error appears, Jetset is trying to find the iCloud storage. iCloud Drive must be enabled for this to work.

To enable iCloud Drive, go to Settings->User account -> iCloud. Make sure iCloud Drive is On.

When you click the iCloud Drive On button, it will take you to the iCloud Drive panel.

If you click **Apps Syncing to iCloud Drive,** you will see Jetset listed:

## Enable iCloud for Jetset

Jetset uses the user’s iCloud storage to write takes to. We use iCloud storage as until recently it was the only place to write files to in iOS that wouldn’t be deleted if the app was removed.

Find this in Settings->User account (the first button on top of the Settings menu) -> iCloud -> Apps Using iCloud -> Show All, and make sure that the slider next to Jetset is enabled:

## Browsing iCloud in Files Apps

If you are still seeing the ‘No iCloud’ error, try opening your Files app in iOS and browsing to the iCloud area. This can frequently catch any remaining problems. If you can browse to the iCloud top directory, Jetset should be able to write to local iCloud storage on the iOS device.
